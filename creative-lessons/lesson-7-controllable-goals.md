_Today's topic is SUPER relatable to recent events. A lot of friends have been pushing me to submit my maps for featuring. I've also seen many people want to give up on Creative because they haven't achieved their goals of getting featured. In Halo there were a lot of people that wanted to give up because they couldn't get their maps into matchmaking. These goals for featuring or an LTM or getting MASSIVE analytics are unreliable goals. My goal personally is to add to my portfolio every week or two (new published or new prototype every week). Let's talk about why a goal like this is much more powerful for you as a creator.__

# Controllable Goals

We all have dreams of growing and succeeding with our passion. Whether it be streaming, or creating maps in games, or creating videos. In order to realize these dreams we set goals to get ourself there. These goals are crucial for maintaining a direction of where our efforts go as well as prioritizing smaller tasks that help us reach these goals. However, many goals are a form of hopes rather than something that can be acted upon or controlled. This results in a more likely chance of failure and a feeling of no progress towards your dreams.

## Put it in YOUR Hands

Wanting to get one of your creations featured in a game, or up on the front page of a popular website is probably one of the most common "goals" that you will find amongst creators. Here's the thing though, these types of goals are things that other people control. Perhaps the people in charge of featuring accidentally scroll past your submission. Or maybe the person that reviews your submission is not really into that type of content. One little detail could keep you from getting into the spotlight. These are not really goals... goals imply that you are able to make them happen. But the people making things happen in these goals are not you. They are somebody else. Why have your success rely on someone else's actions when you could instead create your own success?

## Create your own Hope

When you get rejected for something you wanted, you will go through at least a little feeling of being helpless. That your goals are unachievable because someone could potentially always get in the way. If you feel this way, it is an indication that your goals are not really goals but are hopes instead. Let's flip this around and change the narrative to something you can control. Getting featured or noticed is typically a chance based event. So best way to overcome poor probability of success is to increase the frequency of the event. This gives you multiple opportunities to succeed, not just one. So rather than focus on getting noticed, instead build so much content that people cannot help but notice. Eventually, someone is going to notice the elephant growing in the middle of the room. If your goal is to get one of your pieces of content featured in a game. The best thing you can do is have so many pieces of content, that eventually one of them is going to get in.

## Tangible Progress

Throw a bunch of ideas at the wall until one sticks. Use **Innovation** so you aren't just throwing the same thing over and over again. **Apply Theories** the moment you have them so you have a never ending flow of content. Use **Discipline over Motivation** so you never stop creating things. If you are just starting out, then focusing on **Quantity over Quality** will build the skillsets you need to succeed. In this scenario, your goal is to add to your portfolio, NOT to get featured. Adding to your portfolio at a steady rate doesn't just give you more chances to get noticed, but also gives you this feeling of progress. If getting featured takes an average of 6 months in a community, then that is 6 months of feeling like you have made ZERO progress towards your goal. That's enough to make most people quit. However if your goal is to just add to your portfolio, you can do that on a weekly basis and build so much momentum you are guaranteed to break through the glass ceiling.
